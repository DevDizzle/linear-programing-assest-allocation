# Capital Preservation Allocation Using Linear Programming

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Linear Programming (LP)** to optimize the allocation of $250,000 across 25 ETFs, prioritizing **capital preservation** and achieving a **minimum annual return of 2%**. The model minimizes risk while adhering to diversification constraints.

## Key Results
- **Total Investment**: $249,792
- **Annual Return**: 6.66% (exceeds 2% threshold)
- **Top Allocations**:
  - GLD (Gold): $49,984
  - BND (Bonds): $49,982
  - VXUS (International Stocks): $49,981
